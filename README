1. Dependencies
The project has following structure:

+ player/      -- Main algorithm, solves problems.
                  To build player you need latest go-language
                  installed. See http://golang.org/doc/install for
                  instructions.
+ renderer/    -- Visualizer for solutions generated by player.
                  Helps us to review player decisions. To build
                  renderer you need latest haskell-platform installed
                  (see https://www.haskell.org/platform/ for
                  instructions) and a couple of Haskell libs: GLFW and
                  Aeson (and their dependencies). To install them on a
                  UNIX family system type following in a shell:
                  $ cabal install GLFW
                  $ cabal install Aeson
