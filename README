# icfp2015

The project has the following structure:

+ player/      -- The source for play_icfp2015.
                  To build player you need Go 1.4.2 or higher installed.
                  installed. See http://golang.org/doc/install for
                  instructions.
+ core/        -- The algorithms and data structures of our solution.
                  To build core you need Go 1.4.2 or higher installed.
                  installed. See http://golang.org/doc/install for
                  instructions.
+ renderer/    -- Our visualizer.
                  To build renderer you need the latest haskell-platform
                  (see https://www.haskell.org/platform/ for
                  instructions) and a couple of Haskell libs: GLFW and
                  Aeson (and their dependencies). To install them on a
                  UNIX family system type in your shell:
                  $ cabal install GLFW
                  $ cabal install Aeson
+ problems/    -- Input and output for the qualification round.
